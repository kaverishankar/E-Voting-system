Naam Tamilar Katchi,  is a Tamil nationalist party in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. This party's main idol is V. Prabhakaran and his picture is found in all events of the party.
<h3>Water-Sharing Dispute</h3>
<p>The party has launched several agitations in demanding the state's share of water from upstream states, of the Kaveri and Mullaiperiyar rivers.Seeman has also publicly criticized successive regimes' apathy on the issue as well as the illegal sand quarrying of the river beds in the state.</p>

<h3>NLC Situation</h3>
<p>In 2011-2012, when the state of Tamil Nadu was in the midst of a severe power crisis leading to exorbitant power tariffs and failure of industries in the state, the management of Neyveli Lignite Corporation, a central government held entity in Neyveli, Tamil Nadu was contemplating divesting shares to private players. This immediately sparked public unrest in the state, and most of its employees organizing a massive strike against the central government's decision.
  The corporation is accused of then allegedly manipulating its workers and indulging in acts to swiftly play down the issue.</p>
<p>The Naam Tamilar Katchi was among the forefront in opposing the decision, with Seeman declaring that the problem facing strikers was the prejudice of non-Tamil management against Tamil workers. He also attacked NLC for investing in other Indian states while there was an acute power shortage in Tamil Nadu.</p>

<h3>Law and Order</h3>
<p>Seeman has observed of the deteriorating law and order situation in the state during the Congress-DMK alliance. Seeman had also condemned the alleged assault of a group of Lankan tourists in Chennai. Seeman said that the party abhors violence in any form, and cadres who violate the party's principles of conduct will not be tolerated.

<h3>Refugees</h3>
<p>Naam Tamilar Katchi has raised the plight of Sri Lankan Tamils who seek refuge in the country and their prolonged persecution at the hands of both the state and central governments.
