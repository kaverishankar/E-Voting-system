  Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) (transl.â€‰Dravidian Progressive Federation) is a political party in India, particularly in the state of Tamil Nadu and Union Territory of Puducherry.[6] It is currently the Opposition party in Tamil Nadu and is part of the Indian political front the United Progressive Alliance (UPA).
DMK is a Dravidian party, adhering to the social democratic and social justice principles of C. N. Annadurai and Periyar E. V. Ramasamy. It was founded in 1949 by Annadurai as a breakaway faction from the Dravidar Kazhagam (known as Justice Party until 1944) headed by Ramasamy.
DMK was headed by Annadurai (as Secretary general) from 1949 until his death on 3 February 1969. He also served as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 1967 to 1969. Under Annadurai, in 1967, DMK became the first party, other than the Indian National Congress, to win state-level elections with a clear majority on its own in any state in India. M. Karunanidhi followed Annadurai as the first President of DMK from 1969 until his own death on 7 August 2018. He also served as Chief Minister for five non-consecutive terms, in two of which he was dismissed by the Central government. At present, the DMK is led by Karunanidhi's son M. K. Stalin, who served as Deputy Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu from 2009 to 2011. Stalin was elected as the party's Executive Leader in 2017 and then was unanimously elected as Party President by the general body of DMK in 2018, after Karunanidi's death.
Following the 2019 general election, DMK emerged as the third largest party in the Lok Sabha with 24 seats.
